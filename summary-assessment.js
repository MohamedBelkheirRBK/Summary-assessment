  // Theoretical questions.
  // 1- In your own words,Why do we use Closures ?
    var answer1 = `In my experience, I found that closures are most useful when you are iterating, creating objects and functions
                     and would like to keep a reference to each specific variable or object, having to do that without closure would require a lot
                     of repetitive code to implement, closures saves you a lot of time by being able to keep in memory that specific reference in time`
  // 2- In OOP, what does "this" refer to ?
    var answer2 = `this keyword refers to the current context the function is in, which is usually the object you added the function to and
                    called it from`
  // 3- What is jQuery?
    var answer3 = `jQuery is a library developed to help reduce repetitive code while interacting with the DOM, it revolves around the $jQuery object
                   which takes either a string or an object. it can either find a specific object or create one. but that alone has no effect until you
                   run the jquery object methods, which can manipulate the objects you have either in variables or in the DOM`
  // 4- what is the diffrence between Closure's methods and The OOP's methods?
    var answer4 = `Closure methods rely on accessing their own scope, having private variables stored in a local scope that only that one function instance
                   can have access to, but that also means there are more than one function instance. in contrast, OOP methods rely on having the context of
                   where the variable is, be contained within the object that has called the method itself, allowing you to only need one function instance
                   to access multiple non-global variables`
